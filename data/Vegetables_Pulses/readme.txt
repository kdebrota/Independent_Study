This file made available March 30, 2020. 

Yearbook tables contain a time series of the annual per capita supply and
availability data for fresh and processed vegetables and for dry pulse
crops. Included are U.S. production, exports, imports, per capita
availability, and prices. 

 - Variable names are contained in the first row: 
	Decade............(Decade of observation) 
	Year................(Year of observation) 
	Commodity......(Vegetable or pulse commodity) 
	EndUse...........(Market: All uses, Canning, Chips & shoestrings,
	                        Dehydrating, Dry, Freezing, Fresh, Processing)
	Category.........(Data type: Availability, Season Average Price,
	                       Supply, Total, Trade Share) 
	Item...............(Specific data element) 
	Unit...............(Measurement unit) 
	PublishValue..(Data value)  

 - Total Fresh, Total Canning, Total Freezing, and All Dry Beans may not
   be simply the sum of their individual commodities. There is production
   and trade data included in each total that may not appear in any
   individual commodity’s supply and utilization value. 

 - A total industry number can be generated by summing aggregate
   commodity rows only--Total Fresh, Total Canning, Total Freezing, and
   All Dry Beans. Simply summing all rows would not be appropriate
   because aggregate commodity rows already include data from individual
   commodities. 

 - All commodities are presented on a calendar year, except for
   Mushrooms. The marketing year for mushrooms runs from July 1 to
   June 30. The 'year' for mushrooms corresponds to the first in the
   marketing year. For example, 2016 data would correspond to the 2016/17
   marketing year.  

 - The .csv data file contains 30,089 rows of data, one data point per row.
   These data can be found in the three Supply and Utilization sections
   of the Vegetables and Pulses Yearbook (Fresh Market, Processed Market, 
   and Dry Pulse Crops).
